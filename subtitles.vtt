of web accessibility in one minute so

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.930
what is web accessibility it's the idea

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.550
that technology must be equally

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.829
accessible for people with and without

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.460
disabilities and that any barriers to

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.570
accessing the web are removed hi 5:30 BL

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.610
who are we helping when we make our

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.829
sites accessible visitors with visual

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.500
disabilities such as low vision or color

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.420
blindness auditory disabilities such as

deafness cognitive and neurological

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.440

other experiences like visitors on a

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.530
slow internet connection but how do we

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.759
make our sites accessible luckily we

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.560
have established standards to follow

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:17.970
these best practices show us the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.800
importance of having semantic heading

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.929
structures to ensuring proper color

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.330
